# Overview

This folder contains my hello world software

The software is written in Python and just contains a print statement as well as a config comment for the Linux Python interpreter.

This program is the first program of my cse310 university module to show that my GitHub is confugured.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
